This paper describes our submission system (HIT-SCIR) for the CoNLL 2020 shared task: Cross-Framework and Cross-Lingual Meaning Representation Parsing. 

The task includes five frameworks for graph-based meaning representations, i.e., UCCA, EDS, PTG, AMR, and DRG. 

Our solution consists of two sub-systems: 
+ transition-based parser for Flavor (1) frameworks (UCCA, EDS, PTG)
+ iterative inference parser for Flavor (2) frameworks (DRG, AMR). 

In the final evaluation, our system is ranked 3rd among the seven team both in Cross-Framework Track and Cross-Lingual Track, with the macro-averaged MRP F1 score of 0.81/0.69.
