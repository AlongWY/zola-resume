ðŸ¤— Datasets is a lightweight library providing two main features:

one-line dataloaders for many public datasets: 

+ one liners to download and pre-process any of the number of datasets major public datasets (in 467 languages and dialects!) provided on the HuggingFace Datasets Hub. With a simple command like `squad_dataset = load_dataset("squad")`, get any of these datasets ready to use in a dataloader for training/evaluating a ML model (Numpy/Pandas/PyTorch/TensorFlow/JAX),
+ efficient data pre-processing: simple, fast and reproducible data pre-processing for the above public datasets as well as your own local datasets in CSV/JSON/text. With simple commands like `tokenized_dataset = dataset.map(tokenize_example)`, efficiently prepare the dataset for inspection and ML model evaluation and training.
